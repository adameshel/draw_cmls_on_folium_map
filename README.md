# draw_cmls_on_folium_map
Visualize CML locations on a map.
The script reads a csv metadata file and creates and html file.
The metadata file must include the following column names:
`'Link ID', 'Rx Site Latitude', 'Tx Site Latitude', 'Rx Site Longitude', 'Tx Site Longitude'`

`visualize.py` runs with point measuremetns as well. Both options will be operational in parallel for now, but will be merged to one executional code in the future.
